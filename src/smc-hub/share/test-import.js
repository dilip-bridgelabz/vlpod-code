We load a bunch of code just to force some typescript compilation,
and generally improve the chances things will work when actually
launched.  This is run during the build process as a test, so
the build will hopefully fail if things are really broken.

Also, running this module populates ~/.ts-node-cache, which improves
server startup time significantly -- a few seconds instead of a
few **minutes**, since typescript is quite slow.

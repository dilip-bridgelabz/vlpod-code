Permanently delete from the database all project records, where the
project is explicitly deleted already (so the deleted field is true).
Call this function to setup projects for permanent deltion.  This blanks
the user field so the user no longer can access the project, and we don't
know that the user had anything to do with the project.  A separate phase
later then purges these projects from disk as well as the database.

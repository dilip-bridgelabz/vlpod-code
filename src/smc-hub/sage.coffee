# sage.coffee -- TCP interface between NodeJS and a Sage server instance
#
# The TCP interface to the sage server is necessarily "weird" because
# the Sage process that is actually running the code *is* the server
# one talks to via TCP after starting a session.  Since Sage itself is
# blocking when running code, and running as the user when running
# code can't be trusted, e.g., anything in the server can be
# arbitrarily modified, all *control* messages, e.g., sending signals,
# cleaning up, etc. absolutely require making a separate TCP connection.
#
# So:
#
#    1. Make a connection to the TCP server, which runs as root and
#       forks on connection.
#
#    2. Create a new session, which drops privileges to a random clean
#       user, and continues to listen on the TCP socket when not doing
#       computations.
#
#    3. Send request-to-exec, etc., messages to the socket in (2)
#       and get back output over (2).
#
#    4. To send a signal, get files, save worksheet state, etc.,
#       make a new connection to the TCP server, and send a message
#       in the freshly forked off process, which runs as root.
#
# With this architecture, the sage process that the user is
# interacting with has ultimate control over the messages it sends and
# receives (which is incredibly powerful and customizable), with no
# stupid pexpect or anything else like that to get in the way.  At the
# same time, we still have a root out-of-process control mechanism,
# though with the overhead of establishing a new connection each time.
# Since control messages are much less frequent, this overhead is
# acceptable.

## Compute Environment

Here is a description of two optional files describing the content of the computational environment (programming languages, libraries, ...)

Do this if you want to test rendering with the full production data for `compute-*.json`:
```
~/cocalc/src/webapp-lib$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/cocalc-compute-environment/compute-components.json > compute-components.json
~/cocalc/src/webapp-lib$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/cocalc-compute-environment/compute-inventory.json > compute-inventory.json
```
Do NOT commit this to the repo.

### `compute-inventory.json`

This is the "ground truth" of what is installed in the environment. Layout:

```
{
 "language_exes":             map of a full executable path to this dictionary:
   {
   "path to executable":
     {
       "doc"   : documentation string
       "lang"  : language (python, R, ...)
       "name"  : Anaconda R
       "url"   : website
     },
   "another path to a language executable":
     { ... }
   }

For each such language and executable path:


  "language name" : e.g. "python"
    {
    "path to executable" : defined in the dictionary above
      {
        "library 1" : "version"
        "library 2" : "version"
        ...
      },
    "path to another executable of that language":
      { ... }
    },
  "another language":
    { ... }
  }
}
```

### `compute-components.json`

This JSON dictionary contains descriptions of each library. It is hand curated or autogenerated from databases. Note, there can be several instances of the same library being installed in the inventory file, while this description file only lists it once.

```
{
 "language": {
   "libary name": {
     "descr"        : "long description of the library",
     "doc"          : "documentation URL",
     "name"         : "Name",
     "summary"      : "short summary",
     "url"          : "website"
   },
   "library 2": { ... }
 },
 "another language" : { ... }
 "executables": {     # special language listing all executables with their full path
   "/bin/bash": {
     "name": "Bash",
     "..." : ...
   }, ...
 }
```

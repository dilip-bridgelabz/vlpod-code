/*
Slightly generalized fs.watch that works even when the directory doesn't exist,
but also doesn't provide any information about what changed.

NOTE: We could maintain the directory listing and just try to update info about the filename,
taking into account the type.  That's probably really hard to get right, and just
debouncing and computing the whole listing is going to be vastly easier and good
enough at least for first round of this.

We assume path is relative to HOME and contained inside of HOME.

The code below deals with two very different cases:
 - when that path doesn't exist: use fs.watch on the parent directory.
        NOTE: this case can't happen when path='', which exists, so we can assume to have read perms on parent.
 - when the path does exist: use fs.watch (hence inotify) on the path itself to report when it changes

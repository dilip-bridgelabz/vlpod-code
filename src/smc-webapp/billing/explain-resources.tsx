              form your personal workspaces, where you privately store your
              files, computational worksheets, and data. You typically run
              computations through a web browser, either via a{" "}

            <h4>Shared resources</h4>
            <div>
              Each project runs on a server, where it shares disk space, CPU,
              and RAM with other projects. Initially, you work in a{" "}
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/trial.html">trial project</A>,
              which runs with default quotas on heavily used machines that are
              rebooted frequently. Upgrading to "member hosting" moves your
              project to a machine with higher-quality hosting and less
              competition for resources.
            </div>
            <Space />

            <h4>Quota upgrades</h4>
            <div>
              By purchasing one or more of our subscriptions or plans, you
              receive a certain amount of{" "}
              <A href="https://doc.cocalc.com/billing.html#quota-upgrades">
                quota upgrades
              </A>
              . Use these upgrades to improve hosting quality, enable internet
              access from within a project or increase quotas for CPU and RAM in
              order to work on larger problems and do more computations
              simultaneously. On top of that, your{" "}
              <HelpEmailLink text={"support questions"} /> are prioritized.
            </div>
            <ul style={{ paddingLeft: "20px" }}>
              <li>
                These upgrades are applied on top of the project{"'"}s free
                quotas.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can upgrade the quotas up to the total amount given by your
                subscription(s) and the upper limits per project.
              </li>
              <li>
                Project collaborators can <em>collectively contribute</em> to
                the same project, in order to increase the quotas of their
                common project &mdash; these contributions add together to
                benefit all project collaborators equally.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may also purchase any plans <em>more than once</em>, in
                order to increase the total amount of upgrades available to you.

    Determine what upgrades should be applied by this user to get

    is by project_id in order (arbitrary, but stable).

    The output is a map {student_project_id:{quota0:x, quota1:y, ...}, ...}, where the quota0:x means
    that account_id will apply x amount of quota0 total.  Thus to actually *do* the upgrading,
    this user (account_id) would go through the project map and set their upgrade contribution
    for the student projects in this course to exactly what is specified by this function.
    Note that no upgrade quota will be deducted from projects outside this course to satisfy
    the upgrade_goal.

    If a student_project_id is missing from the output the contribution is 0; if a quota is
    missing, the contribution is 0.

    The keys of the output map are **exactly** the ids of the projects where the current
    allocation should be *changed*.   That said, we only consider quotas explicitly given
    in the upgrade_goal map.

Collecting together all of the named Actions and Stores interfaces,
so it's easier to use them elsewhere.

For every top level named store:

 - add a section below importing/exporting it
 - add to the States interface
 - also add to the States, Stores and Actions interfaces in redux-hooks.ts

If you don't do this, then things don't get typechecked,
which is VERY BAD.

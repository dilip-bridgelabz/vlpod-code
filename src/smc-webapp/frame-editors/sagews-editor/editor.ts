/*
Top-level react component for editing Sage Worksheets.

Ultimately we'll have several views:

 - a single document view: one big editor, with output widgets (using either codemirror+hacks or prosemirror.)
 - cells view: many codemirror editors, one for each cell

Maybe
 - raw JSON lines view
 - just the input cells
 - just the output from that inputs

/* Ideas:

- Editor that focuses on a single cell.
- Exporting to different formats
- Slideshow
- Sage documentation (e.g., the entire reference manual)
- Snippets
- Terminal (interface to running sage server)
- List of variables you have defined

All this for sagews *or* .ipynb...

- Bash mode cell that becomes part of document.

This is a way to adjust settings for many of the frame tree editors,
with at least spell checking initially. This is something that has
been fundamentally missing from cocalc forever, which is a notion
of settings for a particular file, NOT to just a particular
browser viewing that file.

Initially I need to implement spell checking customization (after
all a person in Austria might collaborate with somebody in both
English and German in different files). But then also things
like "2 spaces for tabs in this .js files", but "4 spaces
for tabs in that .js file"...
